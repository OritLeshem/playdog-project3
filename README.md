PLAYDOG app was invented to help dog's owners to create play dates for thier dogs, and enjoy  time togheter.

We dealt with three tables in our database:  Users, Dogs and Events.
and allow the users to see all dogs, all events, and attandence of dogs of each event.


after registred as a user, you can add dog(s).
than you be able to see all events near by. You be able to create an event
or to join one.
When creating/ Joining an event you can add details such: location, date, hour, discription and more.
the viewsite is either with a list of events or map marked with all events.
